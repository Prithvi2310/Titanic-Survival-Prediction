# Titanic Survival Prediction

This is a project which is an "entry level" attempt of a data science project. This project aims to perform extensive data analysis and gain meaningful insights from the dataset. 

This project will perform classification of the passengers who were on board HMS Titanic back when it met with a deadly accident in 1912.
